# Vegan Foodie API
### by Carmina Familar


### Purpose
The "Vegan Foodie" project is an API designed to connect to a database containing vegan food options at available at various restaurants and establishments. When eating out at restaurants, the Vegan Foodie API offers a solution for vegans who may have trouble finding vegan-friendly foods at particular resataurants that cater to their dietary requirements. 


Users are able to search for food options offered at restaurants. Each restaurant will fall under one of the following categories: "Vegan", "Vegetarian" and "Vegan Options Available". While most food review apps such as Google Maps and HappyCow focus on the establishment's rating, the Vegan Foodie focuses on individual food items where users are able to rate, read and write reviews about the food items available at each establishment, not on the establishment itself.

- Version Control: Git
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
